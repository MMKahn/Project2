## Overview

The purpose and overall goal of this project is to create a vignette about contacting an API using functions we will create to query, parse, and return data in a well-structured format. These functions will drive the remainder of the the task, which will involve exploratory data analysis.

We chose to create a vignette to interact with the beer data API by the [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/faq) project.

```{r}
library(httr)
breweries <- GET("https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries")
str(breweries, max.level = 1)
```

### Function Definitions

This section is dedicated to showcasing all of the functions that went into contacting the API, querying data, and performing our basic exploratory analysis.

```{r API contact}
